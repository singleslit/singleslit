Hi, my name is Hrishikesh Vinod and I'm a college student. 
Life had taken a precious thing away from me for a really long time, and once I got it back, I never gave up on it.

I love innvation and new ideas! My aim since childhood was never really to work at google or apple etc. It was to be a part of something new, something that took the planet earth
to a different league. Leaving a ever-chagning legacy to the upcoming genaration, opening new doors of creativity with the ultimate long term of unleashing power and intelligence
which makes it unable to make life extinct.

And then, I discovered coding as a tool to innovate.

"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you will most certainly be right"
